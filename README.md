Song Lyrics Translator App

As a music lover, I want to be able to translate the lyrics of my favorite songs into my native language so that I can better understand the message and meaning behind the lyrics.

Given that I am on the music lyrics translator webpage, when I input the lyrics and select the source and target languages, I should be able to see the translated lyrics.

Acceptance criteria:

The webpage should have a user-friendly interface that allows me to easily input the lyrics and select the languages.
The translated lyrics should accurately reflect the meaning of the original lyrics.
The webpage should be able to handle different languages and special characters.
The translated lyrics should be displayed on the same page, below the original lyrics.
The webpage should be accessible on both desktop and mobile devices.
