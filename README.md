# Rutgers-Project1 (Quote Translator)

## Overview
```
This project is a web-based application that allows users to select a topic and receive a quote related to that topic. The user can then choose a language from which to translate the quote, and the translated text is displayed on the screen.
```

## How To Use

```
When you open the application, you will see a dropdown menu with different topics. Select a topic and click the "Get Quote" button to receive a related quote.

The quote will be displayed on the screen.

You can then use the language dropdown to select a language. When you choose a language and click the "Translate" button, the translated text will be displayed on the screen.

If you want to load a previous quote, you can click a button in the "Previous Translated Quotes Section," and a modal will appear with the quote details. 
```

## Languages
```
This project uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a simple and intuitive user interface.
```

## API
```
The quote API used in this project is API Ninjas.

The translation is done using the DeepL API.

Both of these APIs require an API key. The API keys used in this project are temporary for demo purposes, so please remember that they may expire or stop working.
